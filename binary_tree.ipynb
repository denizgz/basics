    "Binary Search is a searching algorithm used in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. The idea of binary search is to use the information that the array is sorted and reduce the time complexity to O(Log) \n",

    "### Problem Statement: \n",
    "Given a sorted (in ascending order) integer array nums of n elements and a target value, write a function to search the target in nums. If the target exists, return its index; otherwise, return -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: sorted array (nums) and a target value (target)\n",
    "Output: Index of the target value\n",

    "Set the search space equal to the sorted array\n",
    "Take the middle element of the search space and compare it to the target value.\n",
    "- If the target equals the middle element, you have found the target value. Return the index of the middle element and terminate the function.\n",
    "- If the target is smaller than the middle element, halve the search space by discarding all elements to the right of the middle element and continue the search on its left side because the array is sorted in ascending order. Repeat this step until the target is found.\n",
    "- If the target is greater than the middle element, halve the search space by discarding all elements to the left of the middle element and continue the search on its right side because the array is sorted in ascending order.\n",
    "Repeat this step until the target is found.\n",
